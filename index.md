Computer nerd. Mostly doing Linux systems administration. Software tinkerer. Open source advocate and infosec enthusiast.

I'm on Mastodon:

# Open source software projects

All the code for my projects can be found on [my GitHub.](https://github.com/rastaldev)

[![GitHub badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/GitHub-100000?style=for-the-badge&logo=github&logoColor=white)](https://github.com/RastalDev)

All these projects are for use in a terminal emulator, because that's where I spend the majority of my time. I'm not a webdev or professional software developer, but thought it would be useful to create a website just to reference my open source projects in one place. Hopefully, you find something of use to you.
